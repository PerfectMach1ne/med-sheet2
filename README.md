# MedSheet
Google Sheets API based app for helping me track when I take my meds
## Current plans
* Specialized interpreter for my current Google Sheet (referred to as the "origin sheet")
* Generalized "med sheet" creator
* CLI for updating the "med sheets"
* GUI for updating the "med sheets"
* ~~A mobile app that updates sheets through Python Sheets API~~
## What I had to install to make this run

**gspread**

```pip install gspread```

### And a moment of silence for the roughly anything in the mathematical interval [18,36] commits lots to a git push --force
