# MedSheet 2
### 2024-08-22 note: the project is in progress of being revived!
Google Sheets API based app for helping me track when I take my meds
### Current plans
- [ ] Specialized interpreter for my current Google Sheet (referred to as the "origin sheet")
- [ ] Generalized "med sheet" creator
- [ ] CLI for updating the "med sheets"
- [ ] ~~GUI for updating the "med sheets"~~
- [ ] A mobile app that updates sheets through Python Sheets API
### What I had to install to make this run

**gspread**

```pip install gspread```

**NumPy**

```pip install numpy```

### *And a moment of silence for the roughly anything in the mathematical interval [18,36] commits lots to a git push --force*
